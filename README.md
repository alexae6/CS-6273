<h2> Discrete Event Simulator for Vehicle Routing Problem <h2></h2>

This is a discrete event simulator working on a grid for the vehicle routing problem. It aims to minimize the total distance traveled for each vehicle and has a time constraint in place that all vehicles must travel for less than 40 minutes. It has safety conditions in place to ensure no vehicle collisions and that no more than 50% of the city grid consists of vehicles and delivery locations.

<h3>How to use</h3>
The simulator is built with MATLAB 2021b. It can be run through the main function. When ran, all required simulator inputs will appear in the command window as prompts. There are 5 total functions needed for running- createpaths.m, paths.m, timecheck.m, timecorrection.m, and locationcheck.m
